        <h2>Hi, I'm Sahithi!</h2>

        <p>I'm a second year double majoring in Design | Media Arts and Cognitive Science with a specialization in Computing at UCLA.</p>

        <p>My love for technology all started with the Windows Vista Desktop that my family had back in the early 2010s (we still have it and it’s still in the exact same spot today!). As a 3rd grader recently introduced to a computer, there was only one application I knew how to use: Microsoft Word. ​​I spent hours typing stories just to admire every font and character, their geometry and ligatures. My love of fonts is the reason I was drawn to Khan Academy’s HTML/CSS course, which boasted an image of ‘Hello World’ in different typefaces.</p>
            
        <p>From there, my love for both design and web programming spiraled into what it is today. Crafting lovely experiences for people to navigate while keeping them at the center of my design process is something I’m very passionate about.</p>
            
        <p>Outside of designing, I love creating digital art (@paneerarts on IG!), and doing anything crafty, such as building miniatures and cutting paper. I also am part of Science Olympiad at UCLA as an event volunteer for invitational, regional, and state levels of competition (7 years of SciOly going strong!). You can also find me actively scouting for anything and everything purple or playing internet/computer games (my favorites: Poptropica, Stardew Valley, Firewatch, Omori, Alto’s Odyssey)!</p>

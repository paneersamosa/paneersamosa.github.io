            <h1>BRALLIUM E-COMMERCE WEBSITE</h1>
            <h2>OCTOBER - DECEMBER 2023</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>Brallium was one of three projects under Creative Labs at UCLA for the fall quarter with the mission of creating <span>sustainable, reusable, and multi-functional nipple covers wearable by any gender, ethnicity, skin color, and skin type</span>! Their nipple covers are made out of biodegradable and bacteria resistant material, with a goal of promoting sustainability and eco-friendliness.</p>
            <p>We had a team of 12 people, of which we had 2 designers including me. Maleeha and I were responsible for designing an e-commerce website to provide shoppers with more information about the nipple covers and its impact on sustainable practices, streamline the shopping experience, and offer a place for shopper support.</p>
            <p>Brallium also required the creation of a brand identity and assets, so along with designing the website, we also worked on developing Brallium as a brand through our design.</p>

            <h1>RESEARCH</h1>
            <h2>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS + USER SURVEYS</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>Our guiding questions with our market research was:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How can we effectively market and engage customers through content on biodegradable nipple covers?</li>
                <li>How can we effectively communicate Bralliumâ€™s brand identity, sustainability initiatives, and values to customers?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As such, our <span>goals</span> were as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Investigate competitors' checkout processes and payment options</li>
                <li>Identify areas where competitors excel in terms of website usability and navigation in eCommerce</li>
                <li>Identify ways Brallium as an eCommerce site can innovate, and differentiate itself from competitors based on the insights gathered</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Maleeha and I each researched two competitors. For each, we identified the companyâ€™s purpose, incentives, website layout, strengths, and weaknesses. We also took note of their branding to aid us when we started working on Bralliumâ€™s.</p>
            <p>After our individual research, we discussed what we found to answer our questions. Here were some of our findings:</p>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <p>We also created an outline for our website layout. However, we still had questions that we thought would be answered best by directly asking potential users. We created a user survey, collecting 30+ responses over a period of a week.</p>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <p>Using this information, we created an affinity map to understand what users valued and needed most from shopping for nipple covers.</p>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <p>After taking note of the responses, we were able to discern two types of people who would be shopping from our platform: the experienced user and the inexperienced user. We developed two user personas to guide our designing process.</p>
            <p>With the research done, we ideated wireframes and finalized a low fidelity prototype for the dev teams to get started with (see Design).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>For our visual identity, we started off by making three moodboards of color schemes and potential fonts. Each moodboard had a distinctive vibe that we could see connecting to Bralliumâ€™s brand identity.</p>

                    <h2 class="header">NO PRODUCT PHOTOS</h2>
                    <p class="para">A big challenge we faced while creating wireframes, low fidelity, and even high fidelity prototypes was that Bralliumâ€™s product was overseas where it was developed in China. This meant that we were unable to access or take product photos except for three. Due to this, we were unable to have a focus on photography on the website in the immediate future. We solved this problem by focusing more on graphics and motifs of sustainability.</p>

            <p>The final e-commerce website allows shoppers to gain insights about nipple covers, sustainability, and Brallium while being accessible to inexperienced and experienced users alike. Shoppers can understand the impact of both their purchase and their support for Brallium. Unlike competitors, Brallium is gender-neutral through its photos and assets with an emphasis on inclusivity and diversity.</p>

            <h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="section-content">
            <ol>
                <li><strong>My first experience with user experience research.</strong><br>
                    Through this project, I got the opportunity to learn and follow the UX research process and make thoughtful decisions behind designing and branding. I'm incredibly grateful to my partner Maleeha for leading me through the process and teaching me what I needed to know under such a short time frame. I'm excited to continue practicing what I have learned to craft truly thoughtful, human-centered experiences.</li>
                <li><strong>Never give up!</strong><br>
                    It was easy to feel disheartened while making the high-fidelity prototype since we didn't have product photos, only had two designers, and were on a big time crunch. However, we kept thinking and making new iterations that led up to our finalized design. While I know I should keep trying, it was really encouraging to see the results of pushing through.</li>
